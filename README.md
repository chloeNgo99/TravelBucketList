# TravelBucketList

## Project Introduction
Create a travel bucket list of places that I would like to explore in the future with React.

## Description
- A separate array file that stored all information related to some famous places including: location, name, Google link, date, image, and brief introduction about the destination.
- Use Javascript **.map()** and **props** components to render every item that stored inside the array without hardcoded for each of the entries.
- Using CSS to style and polish the finish product.
